# Bundled object meshes — attribution

`<alias>.glb` — one GLB mesh per challenge object (object frame, **millimeters**),
keyed by SHOW3D object alias. These are the object surfaces that define the
interaction-field target: pose them per frame with the released `R,t`
(`ObjectPoseFrame.pose_vertices`) to get the object in world space.

The meshes are the HOT3D object models from the BOP HOT3D release
(https://huggingface.co/datasets/bop-benchmark/hot3d, `object_models_eval`),
